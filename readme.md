# **Spring Boot Project with AWS Services Integration**

## **Overview**

This repository contains a Spring Boot project designed as a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate the integration with various AWS services. The project leverages AWS CodeBuild, AWS Secrets Manager, IAM Authentication, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, Amazon Deployment Framework, and AWS CloudFormation for a robust and secure CI/CD pipeline and deployment process.

## **Services Used**

1. **AWS CodeBuild (BuildSpec.yml)**: Used for compiling the source code, running tests, and packaging the software.
2. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Manages sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, etc., securely.
3. **IAM Authentication**: Ensures secure access to AWS services and resources.
4. **AWS CodePipeline**: Orchestrates the steps defined for the CI/CD process, from code commit to deployment.
5. **AWS CodeCommit**: Hosts the Git-based source code repository in a secure and scalable environment.
6. **Amazon Deployment Framework**: Manages and automates deployments across multiple AWS accounts and regions.
7. **AWS CloudFormation**: Automates the provisioning and management of the infrastructure in a secure and repeatable manner.

## **Project Structure**

- **`src`**: Contains the source code of the Spring Boot application.
- **`buildspec.yml`**: Configuration file for AWS CodeBuild.
- **`cfn/`**: Contains AWS CloudFormation templates for infrastructure setup.
- Additional configuration files and scripts as necessary.

## **Getting Started**

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions below:

1. Ensure that AWS CLI is configured with appropriate credentials.
2. Update the **`buildspec.yml`** with your specific build and deployment commands.
3. Configure AWS Secrets Manager to manage application secrets and credentials.
4. Set up IAM roles and policies according to your security requirements.
5. Define your CI/CD pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.
6. Commit and push your changes to AWS CodeCommit.
7. Use the Amazon Deployment Framework for multi-account deployment strategies.
8. Customize AWS CloudFormation templates as per your infrastructure needs.

## **Security**

- Do not commit sensitive data into the version control. Use AWS Secrets Manager for managing sensitive information.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when setting up IAM policies.
